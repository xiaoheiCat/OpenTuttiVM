# Runtime Overrides

This document indexes supported runtime override environment variables for local state, transport, logging, diagnostics, and tests.

Use the owner documents linked below for detailed behavior. This file exists to make the supported override surface easy to scan before adding another `TUTTI_*` or `TUTTID_*` variable.

## Rules

- prefer repository-owned generated defaults when no override is required
- prefer shared root overrides such as `TUTTI_STATE_DIR` or `TUTTI_LOG_DIR` before adding per-file variables
- treat override variables as development, packaging, test, and diagnostics controls, not primary product settings
- document a new supported override here and in the narrow owner document in the same change

## Local State And Runtime Paths

OpenTuttiVM server overrides are documented in the service `.env.example` and
are intentionally not part of the Tutti daemon override namespace.

| `OPEN_TUTTI_ACTIVE_ROOM_LIMIT` | [OpenTuttiVM architecture](../architecture/open-tutti-vm.md) | Limits active rooms, including concurrent creations in progress. |

## Desktop Update Admission Development

`@tutti-os/desktop-update-admission` owns the shared, unpackaged-only
`DESKTOP_UPDATE_ADMISSION_*` environment contract used by Tutti Desktop and
TSH Desktop. See the package
[README](../../packages/desktop/update-admission/README.md) for scenario
variables, policy sequences, named scenarios, updater outcomes, foreground
interval overrides, and the loopback mock-server transport.

Packaged daemons ignore the entire environment family before parsing it.
Enabled invalid development scenarios terminate daemon startup with an explicit
configuration error. Electron resolves only the shared current version and
updater simulation; `tuttid` or `desktopd` owns in-process policy, feature,
timeout, sequence, and foreground-interval parsing. In loopback mode the
mock-server process exclusively owns policy, minimum-version, feature-key,
policy-sequence, and named-policy variables. A loopback client daemon rejects
server-owned policy variables instead of creating a second policy source.

## Agent Runtime Diagnostics

Agent Extension source activation is not an environment override. Desktop
Developer settings persist `agent.extension.<key>` in the generic feature flag
map; `tuttid` reconciles the matching configured source after that preference
changes. `TUTTI_AGENT_EXTENSION_<KEY>_ENABLED` is not read.

Local Agent Extension package testing uses
`TUTTI_AGENT_EXTENSION_<KEY>_PACKAGE_DIR`. It is accepted only when
`TUTTI_ENV` resolves to `development` and must point at an unpacked package
directory containing
`tutti.agent.json`. The daemon snapshots validated package bytes into
development state instead of reading mutable repository files at runtime.
The override selects package bytes but does not enable its source; use the
matching Developer setting. Production ignores the variable and still requires
the configured signed HTTPS release.

An Extension account-usage profile normally runs the exact companion package
pinned by the signed profile. For a local package snapshot only,
`TUTTI_AGENT_EXTENSION_<KEY>_ACCOUNT_USAGE_EXECUTABLE` may select one explicit
local companion CommonJS script. The daemon accepts it only in development,
only for an installation with local-package provenance, and only after
verifying an absolute ordinary non-symlink file and its fingerprint. The fixed
Node interpreter is resolved and verified independently. Production ignores
the variable. Result decoding remains bounded and fail-closed, so this override
changes only where local development finds the Provider-owned Helper.

`make dev-gui` clears an inherited
`TUTTI_AGENT_EXTENSION_KIMI_CODE_PACKAGE_DIR` so a stale shell or launch-agent
environment cannot silently replace the signed Kimi Code release. Set
`DEV_GUI_KIMI_CODE_PACKAGE_DIR` to an explicit unpacked package path when that
one development run intentionally needs a local Kimi Code snapshot; the script
then canonicalizes the path and projects it to the generic daemon override. It
also discovers the account-usage Helper from the standard Kimi Extension
repository layout. Use `DEV_GUI_KIMI_CODE_ACCOUNT_USAGE_EXECUTABLE` when the
Helper lives elsewhere. A local package that declares account usage fails
before launch when the self-contained Helper build is missing. An
explicit path that does not exist or lacks `tutti.agent.json` fails before the
GUI starts. The daemon revalidates and snapshots the current directory on every
start and does not fall back to a cached local snapshot when the path becomes
missing or invalid.

Example:

```sh
DEV_GUI_KIMI_CODE_PACKAGE_DIR=/path/to/build/tutti-agent/package \
  make dev-gui
```

`make dev-gui` starts the Electron renderer dev server on Vite's default
port 5173. When another local checkout or another electron-vite project
already occupies that port, set `TUTTI_DESKTOP_DEV_PORT` to pin this run to a
different port; the server then uses `strictPort`, so a collision fails at
startup instead of silently hopping ports.

Example:

```sh
TUTTI_DESKTOP_DEV_PORT=5273 make dev-gui
```

Claude Code always uses the SDK sidecar runtime. Provider availability checks
the `claude` CLI plus the Claude SDK sidecar entry and Node runtime.
Claude-native credential and endpoint values pass through unchanged. Logs may
record only their presence, storage source, expiry metadata, and non-reversible
fingerprints; they must never record values, account names, or personal paths.

Codex and Tutti Agent use the Codex app-server protocol for their model and
dynamic capability catalogs. Their model-list operation has a 30-second
provider-process bound and a 35-second outer catalog-fetch bound; the
capability-list operation has the same 30-second provider-process bound. These
provider-specific windows cover a cold Windows npm shim and the provider's
own model-metadata refresh without widening unrelated status or interactive
session timeouts. The persistent model catalog cache still uses its existing
five-minute success and short failed-fetch windows. A timeout from Codex's own
`codex_models_manager` or a stale runtime-selection error is provider-owned
and is not converted into success by these Tutti bounds.

OpenCode provider availability checks the `opencode` CLI directly and launches
sessions through the official `opencode acp` command. Do not add model,
agent, or auto-mode CLI flags to that ACP command. Session model selection must
be passed through OpenCode config; Tutti injects `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` with
`{"model":"provider/model"}` when a session model override is present. The
custom-provider environment allowlist for OpenCode includes `OPENCODE_CONFIG`,
`OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`, `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`, and `OPENCODE_PERMISSION`
so operator-supplied OpenCode config stays explicit and provider-owned.
AgentGUI Sessions add a final session-scoped `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` overlay that
contains Tutti's managed `AGENTS.md` and native `skills/` tree. The overlay is
created for every OpenCode Session and is removed with that Session's runtime;
it does not write managed Skills into the Workspace or the user's global
OpenCode config directory. A model access plan, when present, writes its
`OPENCODE_CONFIG` file into that same isolated directory.
OpenCode composer model options and model-specific reasoning variants come from
`opencode models --verbose`. Run that command from the composer workspace cwd
because OpenCode resolves project configuration relative to the current
directory. The daemon gives this CLI fetch a 35-second outer request bound and
a 30-second provider-specific process bound to accommodate a cold Windows npm
shim without making other providers slower. Successful catalogs are cached in
memory for five minutes and failed fetches for 30 seconds, but the cache key
includes the workspace cwd and is not persisted across daemon restarts. An
empty `variants` object is authoritative: AgentGUI must not expose or submit an ACP
`effort` value for that model. Do not restore a provider-wide static effort list,
because OpenCode models use different variant vocabularies (for example `max`
rather than `xhigh`) and some reasoning-capable models expose no selectable
variant at all. The provider auth/config watcher still publishes the
`agent.model.catalog.invalidated` event when OpenCode's auth marker
(`~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`) or configured OpenCode config files change
so an open composer refreshes immediately; it invalidates existing in-memory
OpenCode model-list cache entries so the next request refetches for its cwd.
OpenCode composer skill options are discovered with slash triggers
from native `.opencode/skills/*/SKILL.md`, Claude-compatible `.claude/skills`,
agent-compatible `.agents/skills`, global `~/.config/opencode/skills`,
`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, and the `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` skills
directory. Prompt image capability for those options is resolved by the
daemon model capability service: Models.dev is fetched first as the public
model source of truth and cached in memory, then provider-specific rules fill
gaps for private composer models such as Cursor's `composer-*` ids. Speed
derived model ids such as `openai/gpt-5.5-fast` keep the exact Models.dev id
authoritative when it exists, then try the base id (`openai/gpt-5.5`) so
orthogonal speed tiers do not hide base model image support. OpenCode also
advertises the provider-level `imageInput` composer capability; AgentGUI enables
image paste only when both that provider capability and the selected model's
`supportsImageInput` are true. Unknown model image capability remains
unsupported in AgentGUI.

## Review Questions

When adding or changing an override, ask:

1. Can an existing generated default or shared root override express this?
2. Is the variable owned by state, transport, logging, or a narrower subsystem?
3. Is the variable for diagnostics or packaging rather than normal product configuration?
4. Which convention or architecture document must change with this registry?
