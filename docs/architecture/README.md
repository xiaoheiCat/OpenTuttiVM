# Architecture

These documents describe the current implemented structure, ownership, and
data flow of the repository. They are the first stop for understanding how a
subsystem works now.

Proposals and implementation plans live in [Specs and Plans](../specs/README.md).
Stable change rules live in [Conventions](../conventions/README.md).

Move unfinished work to specs, and remove completed rollout history after its
durable decisions are represented here.
