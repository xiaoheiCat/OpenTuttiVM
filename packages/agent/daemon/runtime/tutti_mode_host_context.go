Identify independent workstreams and shape them as parallel groups toward parallelTarget: tasks in the same group carry `parallelizable: true`, share the same dependsOn, and never depend on each other — dependencies always outrank the target and flag, so a parallelizable task that depends on its neighbor just runs serially with a misleading label. "+
		"Parallelizable tasks are safe by construction: each runs in an isolated git worktree branched from the shared checkout, and its work lands on a per-run branch instead of the base checkout. Worktree isolation requires the shared checkout to be a git repository — when the plan starts from a fresh or non-git directory, the first task must initialize one (`git init` plus an initial commit) or every task must carry its own unique absolute execution directory. At schedule time an unsafe concurrent set is rejected; schedule those tasks one at a time instead. Because of that, follow every parallel group with an integration task that dependsOn all group members; its brief must merge the group's branches, resolve overlaps, and verify the combined result (successor prompts receive the exact branch names). Express ordering constraints with dependsOn only. "+

		"If that message requests changes, update the plan document, run `%[1]s plan revise --workflow-id <workflowId> --file <absolute path> --request-id <new id>`, and end the turn again. If the user accepts, Tutti materializes an inert Issue plus an initial execution checkpoint, and this conversation becomes the plan's orchestrator. Inspect the checkpoint and board state, choose no more than parallelTarget exact ready task IDs to run, then invoke `%[1]s plan issue schedule --issue-id <issueId> --checkpoint-id <checkpointId> --expected-graph-revision <revision> --task-ids-json '[\"task-1\"]' --request-id <stable-id>`; the command must schedule exactly the task IDs you selected. After every task settles this conversation is woken again to review evidence and explicitly decide the next graph command; it never executes the child tasks' work itself. The user can steer you with messages at any time, and stopping this conversation stops every running task. A dispatch-paused Issue must stay quiet; when the user explicitly asks to continue, the original source conversation can run `%[1]s plan issue resume --issue-id <issueId> --json` before using the unchanged active checkpoint. When all tasks becoming terminal starts Goal Review, review whether the user's goal is actually satisfied and never infer completion from task counts. Add and schedule more work when needed; otherwise finish only with `%[1]s plan issue complete --issue-id <issueId> --checkpoint-id <checkpointId> --expected-graph-revision <revision> --decision goal_satisfied --request-id <stable-id>`. An independent reviewer verdict is advisory evidence; a negative or inconclusive verdict requires an audited disagreement reason before completion.\n"+
